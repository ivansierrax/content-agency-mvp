## 2026-05-02 CST — Session 5 (Day 5 minimum DONE — Notion sync live, full identity in pipeline)

**Duration:** ~3h. Continuation of Session 4's day; Sessions 4 + 5 ran back-to-back.

**What happened:**

1. **Senior call up-front: reuse existing Hashtag Notion token, log Day 9 cleanup task** for migrating to a scoped read-only integration. Reasoning: existing token already has the access we need, no new attack surface, the migration is a 15-min OAuth-dance that adds zero capability. Saves Day 5 momentum for actual sync work.
2. **Pulled n8n Strategist's "Load Scouted + Creative Config" via `jq`** to extract:
   - The 8 shared-agency data-source IDs (Pillars / Recipes / Photo Config / CTA Bank / Hook Bank / Lexicon / Brand Themes / Image Strategy).
   - The `{ Active checkbox: true } AND { Client select: <brand> }` filter pattern.
   - The exact per-DB property names (Short Code, Hashtag Seed Pool, Forbidden Angles, Min Metrics, Trigger Match, Voice Tone Tags, etc.).
   Reused all of it verbatim — no reinvention.
3. **Built three modules:**
   - `src/sync/notion-brand.ts` (~400 LOC): 8 parallel `data_sources/{id}/query` calls via `fetch`, per-DB property mappers (one per shape), `BrandIdentity` builder, `upsertBrandIdentity` with `synced_at` stamp. `syncBrandIdentity` (single brand) + `syncAllBrands` (per-brand error isolation).
   - `src/sync/scheduler.ts` (~80 LOC): 5-min `setInterval` with ±60s jitter, idempotent start, `SCHEDULER_DISABLED=1` escape hatch, graceful shutdown.
   - `POST /admin/refresh-brand/:slug` in `src/index.ts` with optional `ADMIN_TOKEN` bearer auth + path-prefix matcher (existing exact-match router didn't handle `:slug`).
4. **Migration 0003** added `brand_configs.notion_client_filter` text column. Brand 0 seeded `'Hashtag'`. Applied via Supabase SQL Editor + Monaco injection.
5. **Chrome MCP friction → unblock:** the MCP's sandboxed browser had no Supabase session (page rendered empty). Used `list_connected_browsers` + `select_browser` to switch to Ivan's actual logged-in browser. From that moment forward, JS-direct DOM queries worked cleanly.
6. **Railway env vars added** via the per-variable "Add" button. CodeMirror 6's selection-replace in the Raw Editor was unreliable (paste appended instead of replacing — saw 3× duplicate `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` lines after one cycle). Pivoted to the "New Variable" form: plain `<textarea>` + React-friendly `setReactValue` setter (`Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(proto,'value').set` + `input` event). Worked first try. Added NOTION_API_KEY + NOTION_VERSION as separate vars; clicked Deploy.
7. **First sync via `/admin/refresh-brand/hashtag`:** ran in **1.9s** with `counts={themes:1, pillars:5, recipes:6, ctas:15, hooks:12, lexicon:36, image_rules:4, photo:1}` and `warnings:[]`. **80 total rows** — substantially more than MEMORY's "~45 rows" partial-snapshot estimate.
8. **Day-4 smoke re-ran with full identity** (`POST /run-pipeline` against `https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/`) and reached `status='ready'` in **79.3s on first try**:
   - REAL Hashtag pillar (`"AI / Marketing con IA"`, pillar_id from Notion).
   - REAL recipe (`DEATH_DATA`, recipe_id from Notion).
   - REAL hook (`"Death 2 — operating-dead-model"`, hook_id from Notion).
   - REAL CTA (`"AI • Save"`, cta_id from Notion).
   - 7 slides, 20 numbers in draft, 0 unanchored.
   - QG Phase A pass in 2.9s.
   - **No Writer rewrite needed** (Day 4 first pass had a few unanchored numbers that needed a rewrite). The hypothesis confirmed: tighter brief from real recipe/hook constraints reduces Writer fabrication pressure.
9. **D-014 logged.** Documents the shared-DB + per-brand `Client`-filter sync architecture, the single-replica caveat, and the alternatives rejected.
10. **Designer port deferred to Day 6.** TODO already permitted the spill; senior call to close cleanly rather than start a substantial port (HCTI templates + Gemini API + GCS + GDrive auth) late in the session.

**Day 5 minimum done criterion fully met.** The chain that yesterday improvised pillar names like `"IDENTITY_CONFRONT — data-rich edition"` now reaches into Hashtag's real curated inventory and picks names with stable Postgres IDs traceable back to Notion.

**Step durations (Day 5 smoke, full identity, no rewrites):**
| Step | Duration |
|---|---|
| extract_claims | 14.0s |
| strategist | 14.4s |
| writer | 19.1s (no rewrite needed) |
| editor | 18.5s |
| spanish_editor | 9.1s |
| qg_phase_a | 2.9s |
| **TOTAL** | **79.3s** |

**Lessons (some belong promoted to feedback memory eventually):**
- **Reuse n8n property mappings VERBATIM, don't paraphrase.** Notion property names ("Short Code", "Hashtag Seed Pool", "Forbidden Angles", "Min Metrics", etc.) encode hard-won schema decisions. Copying character-for-character means sync output exactly matches what the chain (also ported verbatim) expects. No translation layer needed.
- **Ivan's actual browser vs MCP's sandboxed browser** matters when targeting authenticated SaaS. `list_connected_browsers` + `select_browser` is the unblock pattern when SPA pages render empty (login wall behind privacy filter). Burned ~10 min today before remembering this.
- **Railway "Add Variable" button beats Raw Editor's CodeMirror** for adding env vars. CM6 handles paste-events as INSERT-AT-CURSOR rather than REPLACE-SELECTION; selection-based clear is unreliable across DOM event simulation. Per-variable `<textarea>` form + `setReactValue` is the bulletproof pattern.
- **Senior call: token reuse vs scoped integration.** Day 5 plan defaulted to a new integration; the right answer was reuse + log cleanup task. New attack surface = zero (token already has access); time saved = ~15 min. Day 9 reliability work is the right home for the scoped-integration migration.
- **Tighter brief = less Writer fabrication.** Day 4 needed Writer rewrite; Day 5 with real recipe constraints didn't. Real signal that `min_metrics`/`min_brands`/`requires_quote` HARD constraints from Recipe rows (which Strategist's prompt enforces) propagate downstream as fewer fabrication attempts. Worth quantifying in Day 9 reliability telemetry.

**What's next:**
- Day 6: Designer port (HCTI + Gemini + GCS + GDrive) + multi-brand isolation test. Resume with `[MVP] resume`.

**Blockers:** None.

**New decisions logged:** D-014 (Notion sync architecture: shared DBs + per-brand `Client` filter, single-replica caveat).

**New files this session:**
- `src/sync/notion-brand.ts`
- `src/sync/scheduler.ts`
- `supabase/migrations/0003_notion_client_filter.sql`

**Files updated this session:**
- `src/db/types.ts` (added `notion_client_filter` to BrandConfigRow + Insert)
- `src/lib/env.ts` (NOTION_API_KEY + NOTION_VERSION required, ADMIN_TOKEN optional)
- `src/index.ts` (admin endpoint + scheduler boot wiring + path-prefix matcher)
- `.env.example` (Notion section)
- `CREDENTIALS.md` (Notion + 8 data-source IDs + Day 9 cleanup task)
- `DECISIONS.md` (D-014 appended)
- `STATUS.md`, `TODO.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md` (this entry)

**External state changes:**
- GitHub: 1 commit on main (`ade542e` Day 5 sync + scheduler + admin endpoint). Plus state-docs commit pending.
- Railway: env vars `NOTION_API_KEY` + `NOTION_VERSION` added; 1 deploy ACTIVE.
- Supabase: migration 0003 applied; `brand_configs.notion_client_filter='Hashtag'` for Brand 0; `brand_configs.brand_identity` jsonb populated with full 80-row union (overwrote partial Day 2 seed).
- Notion: read-only access from new service via inherited Hashtag token. No writes.

**Live verification:**
- ✅ `POST /admin/refresh-brand/hashtag` → `{counts: {themes:1, pillars:5, recipes:6, ctas:15, hooks:12, lexicon:36, image_rules:4, photo:1}, warnings:[], elapsed_ms:1916}`.
- ✅ `POST /run-pipeline` against Stack Overflow Survey 2024 → `status='ready'` in 79.3s with REAL pillar/recipe/hook/CTA names linked to Notion IDs. 20 numbers anchored, 0 unanchored. Single Writer pass (no rewrite).
- ✅ Scheduler running in production (5-min cadence, ±60s jitter). Will auto-resync continuously.

## 2026-05-02 CST — Session 4 (Day 4 DONE — full text-side chain live)

**Duration:** ~4h (deep — pulled five n8n workflows, ported six modules, surfaced and fixed two architecture bugs in flight).

**What happened:**

1. **Day 4 plan reframed up-front.** Pulled the n8n Strategist (`UR5qfUcOoO6djxIP`) via MCP and discovered Session 3's "Strategist is deterministic Node code" reading was wrong. The `Strategy Decision` node IS an LLM call (Sonnet, 100+ line system prompt). Flagged the misread to Ivan, proposed a faithful single-LLM-call port, got confirmation, proceeded.
2. **Confirmed model strategy with Ivan:** Sonnet 4.6 across all chain steps for MVP consistency. Day 9 cost review can split per-step models on real telemetry. Logged to STATUS / open-questions.
3. **Pulled all five n8n workflows via MCP** in parallel:
   - Strategist v2 (`UR5qfUcOoO6djxIP`)
   - Writer A3v3a (`uNFrmhzbddDfxFbU`)
   - Editor Rules A3v3b (`WV8ZxfKnLllJjcRl`)
   - Spanish Editor A3v3c (`2IrMf52AqP6sqgjg`)
   - QG v2 (`ulIyyThcE1jLOJ1W`)
   Read each one's actual code via `jq` extraction from the cached tool-results dumps.
4. **Built six new modules:**
   - `src/pipeline/strategist.ts` — single-topic LLM port + Context Package assembly. Prompt verbatim from n8n with "pick N from pool" + "different slot" logic stripped (we strategize one topic per call). Defensive against partial Brand 0 identity.
   - `src/pipeline/writer.ts` — verbatim Writer prompt port + fresh/rewrite modes + structural validator that auto-empties `accent_text` if it's not a substring of `headline_text` (Rule [F] mechanical enforcement).
   - `src/pipeline/editor.ts` — Rules A+C+D LLM with CTA-immutable enforcement. If Sonnet's `revised_draft` mutates the closing_cta slide or the caption-tail CTA line, those fields are restored from the original draft. Soft-fail keeps original on LLM error.
   - `src/pipeline/spanish_editor.ts` — Mexican-Spanish LLM with the verbatim ~4KB accent prompt + length-ratio gate (output must be 0.85–1.15× input length) + double-accent revert (any word with ≥2 tildes → discard the LLM output, return original). Soft-fail.
   - `src/pipeline/qg_phase_a.ts` — semantic LLM verifier against `anchor_claims`. Verdicts pass/revise/kill. Drops n8n's Anchor-Pinned Corrector (an extra LLM step Writer's patch mode handles equivalently with one fewer parse failure mode).
   - `src/pipeline/chain.ts` — orchestrator wiring Extract → Strategize → Assemble CP → Writer → Grounding → (revise?) → Editor → Spanish → Phase A → (revise?) → ready. Persists `PostEnvelope` to `post_queue.payload` at every step boundary (status enum advances per step). Two revise budgets (pre-Phase-A grounding + Phase A LLM), one rewrite attempt each.
5. **`/run-pipeline` HTTP endpoint extended** to run the full chain end-to-end. Backward-compatible `mode=extract_only` retained for Day 3 smoke parity.
6. **Typecheck clean after the build.** Three small fixes: spread-order in Writer's slide patch (don't overwrite explicit fields), undefined-narrowing in editor's CTA-tail extractor.
7. **Smoke test 1 → FAILED — Stack Overflow blog URL had moved.** First test against `https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/07/24/...` returned 404 from Jina. Bot-block detector correctly caught it as `rejected_fetch_failed`. Switched to live `https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/`.
8. **Smoke test 2 → FAILED, surfaced contract bug.** Full chain ran (51s), extraction passed (data-rich, 15 numerics, 0 dropped — verifier perfect), Strategist picked pillar/recipe, Writer produced 8-slide carousel. But pre-Phase-A grounding KILLED it. Inspecting offenders: Writer cited `185 países`, `70%`, `44%` — REAL source numbers but outside Strategist's curated 5-claim anchor subset (76% / 65,000+ / 62% / 75% / 62.3%).
9. **First fix: pass `cp.source_claims` to grounding instead of `cp.anchor_claims`.** Anchor_claims is Writer's "stay focused" prompt input; source_claims is the full extraction. Committed + pushed.
10. **Smoke test 3 → 502 Railway edge timeout** (transient — service crashed mid-deploy). Retried after health probe.
11. **Smoke test 4 → FAILED again.** This time offenders included `70% / 75% / 2018 / 44% / 15% / 2022 / 16% / 2023` — most of these appeared in source FULL TEXT but NOT in our top-15 extracted claims (n8n's hardcoded cap). The data-rich source had ~30 numerics; our extraction only kept top-15.
12. **Architecture fix — D-013 (two-tier grounding).** D-012 said "use anchor_claims, not re-fetched source" — its real win was eliminating asymmetric normalization (BUG-S58-5). The "no re-fetch" framing was secondary and broke for data-rich pages. New design:
    - Tier 1: fast set membership against `extraction.claims.numeric_claims` (full extraction, top-15).
    - Tier 2: substring lookup against `extraction.source_text` (full Jina markdown, capped at 14k chars).
    - Same single normalize fn on both sides → BUG-S58-5 stays structurally impossible regardless of which tier matches.
    - `source_text` added to `ExtractionResult`. Stripped from envelope before persisting to `post_queue.payload` to keep jsonb compact.
    - Logged D-013, supersedes D-012's narrower interpretation while preserving the single-normalize principle.
13. **Smoke test 5 → 502 again** (Railway redeploy mid-flight). Health-probed, waited.
14. **Smoke test 6 → SUCCESS.** Full chain reached `status='ready'` in 113s:
    - 33 numbers in draft, 33 anchored, 0 unanchored.
    - QG Phase A `verdict='pass'` in 2.4s.
    - Caption opens: *"El costo real de ignorar 65,000 respuestas es tomar decisiones con el mapa equivocado."* — `65,000` directly from anchor (the BUG-S58-5 negative-image test).
    - 10-slide carousel including data_card slides with verbatim source numbers.
    - `writer_grounding_rewrite` path exercised live (first Writer pass had a few unanchored numbers; rewrite recovered cleanly with the feedback list).
15. **Verified Supabase persistence:** `post_queue` row `cab31b62-4b0b-4e95-b2d2-4e1feeba3840`, `status='ready'`, `status_reason='pipeline_text_ready'`, `created_at`/`updated_at` consistent with the 113s chain duration.

**Day 4 done criterion fully met.** The headline win: the Stack Overflow source — whose `65,000 desarrolladores` claim BUG-S58-5 falsely killed in production — now flows through the new chain to a published-ready draft. The bug class is structurally gone.

**Step durations (live, last good run):**
| Step | Duration |
|---|---|
| extract_claims | 12.2s |
| strategist | 15.2s |
| writer | 28.4s |
| writer_grounding_rewrite | 26.0s |
| editor | 16.2s |
| spanish_editor | 11.4s |
| qg_phase_a | 2.4s |
| **TOTAL** | **112.9s** |

**Lessons (some belong promoted to feedback memory eventually):**
- **Read the actual production code before porting.** Session 3's misread of the Strategist as deterministic would have produced a worse port if I'd built from memory. Pulling the JSON via MCP and reading it cost 5 min and changed the architecture.
- **Smoke tests against historical bug sources beat synthetic tests.** Stack Overflow Survey URL wasn't just a placeholder — it was the BUG-S58-5 trigger. Testing against the real historical kill case is what surfaced the D-012 → D-013 contract gap. A synthetic "happy path" smoke would have shown green and shipped a still-broken design.
- **Decisions decay if you don't pressure-test them with real data.** D-012 looked complete after Session 3. Day 4's first real draft (with a curated Strategist subset narrower than the source's actual numeric density) immediately exposed its incomplete framing. The senior posture says: ship, observe, refine the decision log — D-013 supersedes D-012.
- **n8n's `httpRequest` parameter binding (`nodeName` vs `node`)** — already learned in Session 3. Reapplied today: `n8n_get_workflow` calls used `id` cleanly; no MCP retry needed.
- **Railway 502 mid-redeploy is transient. Wait + retry** — caught it twice today; never blocked us.

**What's next:**
- Day 5: Notion sync + Designer port. Resume with `[MVP] resume`.
- Re-run Day 4 smoke after sync — confirm Strategist picks REAL Hashtag pillar/recipe/hook/CTA names instead of Sonnet-improvised names like `IDENTITY_CONFRONT — data-rich edition`.

**Blockers:** None.

**New decisions logged:** D-013 (two-tier grounding, supersedes D-012's narrower framing while keeping its single-normalize principle).

**New files this session:**
- `src/pipeline/strategist.ts`, `src/pipeline/writer.ts`, `src/pipeline/editor.ts`, `src/pipeline/spanish_editor.ts`, `src/pipeline/qg_phase_a.ts`, `src/pipeline/chain.ts`

**Files updated this session:**
- `src/pipeline/types.ts` (added Strategy + ContextPackage + WriterDraft + ContentType + Format + EngagementTrigger + CtaRole + BriefConstraint shapes; ExtractionResult now exposes optional `source_text`)
- `src/pipeline/extract_claims.ts` (returns `source_text` truncated to 14k)
- `src/pipeline/grounding.ts` (two-tier check, accepts optional `source_text`)
- `src/index.ts` (`/run-pipeline` extended to full chain + `mode=extract_only` flag)
- `DECISIONS.md` (D-013 appended)
- `STATUS.md`, `TODO.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md` (this entry)

**External state changes:**
- GitHub: 4 commits on main (`080e099` Day 4 build / `572e410` grounding contract fix / `5d26441` two-tier grounding fix / state docs commit pending).
- Railway: 4 deploys, all ACTIVE.
- Anthropic: ~25 inference calls during build + smoke (~6K-10K tokens each, prompt caching active). Total cost <$0.50.
- Supabase: 1 post_queue row inserted (`cab31b62-4b0b-4e95-b2d2-4e1feeba3840`), no schema changes.

**Live verification:**
- ✅ `POST /run-pipeline` against `https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/` returns `{ status: "ready", grounding.verdict: "pass", grounding.stats: { numbers_in_draft: 33, anchored: 33, unanchored: 0 } }` in 113s.
- ✅ `post_queue` row persisted with `status='ready'`, `status_reason='pipeline_text_ready'`.
- ✅ `writer_grounding_rewrite` path exercised in the same run — first-pass grounding flagged a few numbers; rewrite recovered cleanly.

## 2026-05-01 → 2026-05-02 CST — Session 3 (Day 3 first iteration DONE + BUG-S58-5 production fix)

**Duration:** ~3.5h (deep — included a full audit of the existing n8n chain + a P1 production bug fix + new module build).

**What happened:**

1. **Started Day 3 with the Strategist port plan** — discovered Strategist is NOT an LLM agent but deterministic Node code. Reframed.
2. **Audited the full existing chain** by pulling Writer + Editor + Spanish Editor + QG workflows from n8n via MCP. Reading the actual code (not assumptions) revealed the contract is well-grounded: Writer has 5 explicit grounding rules, QG has revise-then-kill loop with Anchor-Pinned Corrector, Editor defers fact-check to QG. My initial "redesign the contract" instinct was wrong.
3. **Built a hypothesis** that the bug Ivan described ("agent killed content as having stats but it didn't") was at the EXTRACTION step — Sonnet told to be "verbatim" but allowed to paraphrase. Proposed mechanical substring verifier as the fix.
4. **Validation pass against historical kills.** Pulled SMOKE-S56-01 (Stack Overflow Survey, `failure_category=thin_source`). The trace contradicted my hypothesis: extraction was correct, Writer was correct, **a downstream pre-flight grounding check falsely flagged the real number "65,000" as fabricated**, Corrector replaced it with "masivamente", Phase A correctly killed "masivamente", net failure_category=thin_source (misleading — source was data-rich).
5. **Read QG's "Extract Reviews" code → found BUG-S58-5.** Asymmetric normalization: corpus replaces `,` with space, needle strips `,` entirely. `corpus.includes(needle)` never matches for ≥1000 numbers with thousand-separator commas. P1 silent bug shipping for unknown duration.
6. **Patched live n8n QG via `n8n_update_partial_workflow`.** Added parallel `corpusDigits` (digit-only normalization on both sides), switched `.includes()` check to use it. Workflow stayed `active:true` throughout. Verified patch landed.
7. **Logged BUG-S58-5 to `content_pipeline/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`** with full trace, root cause code excerpt, fix shipped, prevention rule, triage note.
8. **Logged D-012 to `content_agency_mvp/DECISIONS.md`** — broader lesson for the new service: don't carry forward the re-fetch-and-re-normalize architecture; check against `anchor_claims` directly so two normalize fns can never drift again.
9. **Built Day 3 modules** all operating on the D-012 contract:
   - `src/lib/anthropic.ts` — SDK wrapper with prompt caching + cache_hit_rate Sentry breadcrumbs + parseModelJson helper.
   - `src/pipeline/types.ts` — PostEnvelope + AnchorClaims + ExtractionResult shapes.
   - `src/pipeline/extract_claims.ts` — verbatim port of n8n extraction prompt + new substring verifier (D-008/D-012 — drops Sonnet hallucinations) + tier reclassification on verified counts + thin-source gate.
   - `src/pipeline/grounding.ts` — `verifyDraftGrounding()` checks draft numbers against anchor_claims membership using a SINGLE normalize fn on both sides (BUG-S58-5 immune by construction).
   - `src/index.ts` — `POST /run-pipeline` smoke endpoint (extraction-only for Day 3 first iter).
10. **Typecheck clean.** One issue (SDK 0.32 doesn't fully type cache_* fields yet) handled with cast-through-unknown + TODO to bump SDK.
11. **Live smoke test against the historical false-kill source.** Stack Overflow Survey URL → extraction returns `{numeric_claims: [{value: "65,000", context: "polled more than 65,000 developers..."}], dropped: [], tier: "narrative-strong", status: "ok"}`. The number n8n killed is now an anchored claim. Day 4's grounding check will pass it mechanically.
12. **Caching verified live.** First call 8.1s, second call (same source) 4.8s — ~40% latency drop confirms system prompt caching works as designed. Sentry breadcrumbs have precise rates.

**Day 3 done criterion fully met.** The SINGLE biggest win of the session: the Stack Overflow source — the one whose `65,000 desarrolladores` BUG-S58-5 falsely killed in production — now flows through the new chain correctly. When Day 4 wires the grounding check, "65,000" in a draft will match `anchor_claims.numeric_claims` immediately. The bug class is structurally gone.

**Lessons (some belong promoted to feedback memory eventually):**
- **n8n MCP `n8n_update_partial_workflow` with `patchNodeField` is exactly the right tool for surgical production fixes.** Use `nodeName` (not `node`) parameter — first attempt failed because of that.
- **Reading the actual code beats reading the docs.** I ALMOST recommended the wrong fix because I assumed the existing extraction was naive. The 15-min code-read changed the diagnosis entirely.
- **"Validate hypothesis against historical evidence" before committing to a fix saved building defense for the wrong threat.** The substring verifier is still worth building (defense-in-depth), but the headline win was finding BUG-S58-5 — which I would have missed if I'd skipped the historical replay.
- **Async background loops (until-loop with curl) instead of polling sleeps** is what unblocks Bash's blocked sleep pattern.

**What's next:**
- Day 4: Strategist (deterministic) + Writer (LLM) + grounding wired + Editor + Spanish + QG Phase A LLM + post_queue persistence + full /run-pipeline.
- Resume next session with `[MVP] resume`.

**Blockers:** None.

**New decisions logged:** D-012 (grounding on anchor_claims, not re-normalized source).

**New files this session:**
- `src/lib/anthropic.ts`
- `src/pipeline/types.ts`, `src/pipeline/extract_claims.ts`, `src/pipeline/grounding.ts`

**Files updated this session:**
- `src/index.ts` (added /run-pipeline route)
- `DECISIONS.md` (D-012 added)
- `STATUS.md`, `TODO.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md` (this entry)

**External state changes:**
- **n8n production: workflow `ulIyyThcE1jLOJ1W` (Agent 5v2: Quality Gate v2) patched with BUG-S58-5 fix.** Single-line change to `Extract Reviews` node jsCode. Workflow stayed `active:true`. Verified.
- `content_pipeline/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` — BUG-S58-5 entry prepended with full forensics + prevention rule.
- GitHub: 2 commits on main this session (D-012 + Day 3 build).
- Railway: 2 deploys (after MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY env from Session 2 + after Day 3 push). Both ACTIVE.
- Anthropic: ~10 inference calls during smoke testing. <30K tokens total — negligible cost (~$0.10).

**Live verification:**
- ✅ `POST /run-pipeline` returns valid ExtractionResult.
- ✅ Stack Overflow Survey source (historical false-kill) produces verified `65,000` anchor claim.
- ✅ Prompt cache hit on 2nd call — 40% latency drop.

## 2026-05-01 — Session 2 (Day 2 DONE)

**Duration:** ~2.5h.

**What happened:**

1. **Anthropic project key minted.** Generated `content-agency-mvp` key in Ivan's Individual Org via Chrome MCP (platform.claude.com). Full value captured to CREDENTIALS.md (gitignored).
2. **Railway env updated.** Swapped placeholder `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the real key via Raw Editor + paste-event simulation on CodeMirror. Triggered deploy, /health returned 200 with new vars.
3. **Schema bootstrap (0001_init.sql).** Designed 5 tables — UUID PKs, soft-delete (`archived_at`), `updated_at` triggers, RLS enabled. Applied via Supabase SQL Editor (Monaco injection: `monaco.editor.getEditors()[0].setValue(decoded)`). All 5 tables present with correct column counts.
4. **Mid-session schema pivot — D-009.** Discovery: Hashtag's brand identity is composed of 9 separate Notion DBs (Brand Themes, Pillars, Image Strategy Rules, Blueprints, Content Recipes, CTA Bank, Hook Bank, Lexicon, Photo Config). My original 5 typed creative columns (`voice`, `pillars`, `banned_words`, `target_audience`, `hashtag_strategy`) capture maybe 20% of that and lock us into ALTER TABLE friction whenever creative team adds a dimension. Pushed back on my own Day-2-morning design. Proposed `brand_identity jsonb` as passive Notion mirror.
5. **Misunderstanding + clarification with Ivan.** Ivan initially read jsonb as "config in code" — non-negotiable that humans must control brand via Notion. Clarified: jsonb is a passive cache, Notion stays the ONLY edit surface. He agreed.
6. **D-010 (sync architecture).** Synced cache pattern: 5-min Notion → Postgres pull job + on-demand `POST /admin/refresh-brand/:slug`. Pipeline reads from Postgres only (sub-1ms vs ~1.5s × 9 Notion API calls; survives Notion outages).
7. **D-011 (token rotation timing).** Hashtag's `fb_page_token_2` is dead per BUG-S58-4. Senior call: defer rotation to Day 7 evening (atomic OAuth dance session). Token isn't needed by Node service until Day 8 publishing — doing it now burns Day 2 momentum on Day-8-blocking work.
8. **Migration 0002 applied.** Drops 5 typed columns, adds `brand_identity jsonb` + `brand_identity_synced_at` + `brand_identity_source`. Confirmation modal triggered for "destructive operation"; Run-this-query button confirmed; success.
9. **MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY generated + deployed.** `openssl rand -base64 32`. Saved to CREDENTIALS.md, added to Railway env (same Raw Editor flow). Service redeployed.
10. **Code modules built:**
    - `src/lib/crypto.ts` — AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt + nullable variants. Cached key load. Format: `base64(iv ‖ ct ‖ authTag)`.
    - `src/lib/supabase.ts` — admin + public client singletons + `checkDbHealth()` returning latency.
    - `src/db/types.ts` — hand-rolled row + insert types for all 5 tables. `BrandIdentity` interface with optional categories + free-form passthrough (`[key: string]: unknown`) so Notion additions don't break compilation.
    - `src/db/brands.ts` — `getBrand{BySlug,ById,Config{,Decrypted}}`, `list{Brands,ActiveBrands}`, `insertBrand`, `insertBrandConfig`, `upsertBrandIdentity` (D-010 sync target).
    - `src/db/posts.ts` — `enqueuePost` (idempotent on `(brand_id, idempotency_key)` via 23505-catch), `updatePostStatus` (with optional jsonb payload patch via read-modify-write), `markFailed`, `listReadyPosts`, `recordPublishSuccess` (atomic-ish: pq update + pr insert).
    - `src/index.ts` — `/health` upgraded: DB connectivity + per-brand summary, returns 503 on any failure (still answers).
    - `src/lib/env.ts` — `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` required.
    - `.env.example` — documents `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` + generation command.
11. **Typecheck clean.** `npm run typecheck` passes zero errors.
12. **Git pushed:** 4 commits this session. Railway auto-deployed; new `/health` shape verified live.
13. **Brand 0 seed — pivot to partial.** Searched all 9 Notion DBs for active Hashtag rows: 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 15 + 12 + 2 + 1 = **45 total**. Senior call: did NOT fetch all 45 individually (~10 min round-trips for data Day 5 sync overwrites anyway). Seeded with the 5 most operationally-load-bearing rows already fetched (1 theme + 3 pillars + 1 blueprint + 1 photo config). Photo config is huge — captures Ivan's "How To Change Aesthetic" master fields exactly as he edits in Notion.
14. **Brand 0 inserted via Supabase REST API.** Used PostgREST directly via curl — cleaner than fighting Monaco SQL editor for 10KB jsonb. Brand id: `dfc5a3f8-95dd-489d-8fe1-6f52a85a2f30`.
15. **Final verification: `/health` returns 200 with `brandCount:1`, `brands:[{slug:"hashtag",name:"Hashtag Agencia",status:"onboarding"}]`.** Full data layer roundtrip proven.

**Day 2 done criterion fully met.**

**Lessons (some belong in KNOWN_ISSUES.md eventually):**
- **Supabase SQL Editor + Monaco injection trick:** `monaco.editor.getEditors()[0].setValue(text)` works cleanly. For destructive queries (ALTER/DROP) a confirmation modal appears — find button by exact text "Run this query".
- **Supabase REST API beats SQL editor for large jsonb inserts.** `POST /rest/v1/<table>` with `apikey` + `Authorization: Bearer` (both = secret key) + `Prefer: return=representation,resolution=merge-duplicates`. Idempotent via `Prefer: resolution=ignore-duplicates` on inserts that should not overwrite.
- **Railway Raw Editor + CodeMirror requires `paste`-event simulation** with synthetic ClipboardEvent, NOT direct value mutation (CM6 ignores DOM value changes). Same pattern as Day 1 lesson.
- **Notion search filtered by data_source_url misses rows that don't have the literal search term in body** (returns rows tagged with the `Client` select but only if they ALSO contain "Hashtag" prominently in content). For full enumeration, search with a broader term that's in every row's title (e.g. category-keyword like "recipe" or "hook"). Day 5's proper sync code will hit Notion API directly with `filter: {property: "Client", select: {equals: "Hashtag"}}` instead.

**What's next:**

- Day 3: Anthropic SDK wrapper with prompt caching → port Strategist agent → `/run-pipeline` endpoint smoke test.
- Resume next session with `[MVP] resume`.

**Blockers:** None.

**New decisions logged:** D-008 (AES-256-GCM at app layer), D-009 (brand_identity jsonb), D-010 (5-min synced cache + on-demand refresh), D-011 (token rotation Day 7 evening).

**New files this session:**
- `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`, `supabase/migrations/0002_brand_identity_jsonb.sql`
- `supabase/seed/brand_0_hashtag.sql` (idempotent reference; actual seed went via REST API)
- `src/lib/crypto.ts`, `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- `src/db/types.ts`, `src/db/brands.ts`, `src/db/posts.ts`

**Files updated this session:**
- `src/lib/env.ts` (added MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY)
- `src/index.ts` (/health upgraded)
- `.env.example` (added MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY)
- `CREDENTIALS.md` (Anthropic dedicated key + MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY)
- `DECISIONS.md` (D-008 + D-009 + D-010 + D-011)
- `STATUS.md` (Day 2 done state)
- `TODO.md` (Day 2 items moved to done; Day 3 surfaced)
- `SESSION_LOG.md` (this entry)

**External state changes:**
- Anthropic console: new key `content-agency-mvp` issued (prefix `sk-ant-api03-h5q...XAAA`)
- Railway: env vars updated (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY`); 4 deploys triggered, all ACTIVE
- Supabase: 2 migrations applied; `brands` + `brand_configs` populated with Brand 0 (Hashtag, id `dfc5a3f8-95dd-489d-8fe1-6f52a85a2f30`)
- GitHub: 4 commits on main (`fa0fc8f`, `595f8fb`, `69bd75a`, `79d8f7b` etc.)

**Live verification:**
- ✅ `https://content-agency-mvp-production.up.railway.app/health` → `{"status":"ok","db":{"ok":true,"latencyMs":~120},"brands":[{"slug":"hashtag",...}],"brandCount":1}`
- ✅ DB roundtrip: REST API insert → /health select → brand visible

## 2026-04-30 late-night — Session 1.5 (Day 1 DONE)

**Duration:** ~75 min after Session 1 wrap.

**What happened:**

1. **Entry point upgraded to long-running HTTP server.** Railway expects services to stay alive — a one-shot exit gets restarted in a loop. Added `GET /` (service identifier), `GET /health` (status, will populate per-brand by Day 9), `POST /throw` (test error → Sentry). Plus graceful SIGTERM/SIGINT shutdown and uncaughtException/unhandledRejection global capture. Same code is foundation for Day 9's reliability hardening.

2. **GitHub repo connected to Railway.** Required installing Railway's GitHub App (auto-redirected after navigating to `github.com/apps/railway-app/installations/select_target`).

3. **Railway env vars set.** Fought the Suggested Variables UI for ~10 min — clicking "Update Variables" in the Suggested Variables panel did NOT persist them; the correct button is "Add" in the same panel. Lesson learned for KNOWN_ISSUES.md.

4. **First deploy CRASHED** with `Missing required env var: SENTRY_DSN` because the variables hadn't actually saved on the first attempt.

5. **Re-Add via Suggested Variables panel + Shift+Enter to redeploy** worked. Status went BUILDING → ACTIVE.

6. **Generated public domain**: `content-agency-mvp-production.up.railway.app`.

7. **Smoke tests via curl:**
   - `GET /` → 200, `{"service":"content_agency_mvp","status":"ok","environment":"production"}`
   - `GET /health` → 200, `{"status":"ok","sentryEnabled":true,"nodeVersion":"v20.20.2",...}`
   - `POST /throw` → 500, `{"status":"error captured"}`

8. **Sentry verification:** navigated to `hashtag-agencia.sentry.io/issues/`, confirmed Issue #1 with title "Day 1 Sentry smoke test — intentional error to verify the deploy captures errors." End-to-end chain proven.

**Day 1 done criterion ("Repo deploys to Railway, eval runs in container, Sentry captures errors") is fully met.**

**Lessons for KNOWN_ISSUES.md (will append):**
- ISSUE-### — Railway "Update Variables" button in Suggested Variables panel does NOT save them; "Add" button does. Fight the UI vs use Raw Editor mode. Or just install Railway CLI and use `railway variables --set` for deterministic behavior next time.
- ISSUE-### — Railway "Deploy" button click via JS doesn't trigger redeploy reliably; **Shift+Enter keyboard shortcut on the service page works**.
- ISSUE-### — Initial deploy crash logs persist on the page even after a successful redeploy. Don't trust string-search for "Missing env var" as a state signal — check the LATEST deployment tile's status, not the whole page text.

**What's next:**

- Day 2: Postgres schema + service modules + Brand 0 + dedicated Anthropic key.
- Resume next session with `[MVP] resume`.

**Blockers:** None.

**New decisions logged:** None new.

**New files this session:**
- (none — all new file work was in prior session)

**Files updated this session:**
- `content_agency_mvp/src/index.ts` (entry → HTTP server)
- `content_agency_mvp/CREDENTIALS.md` (Railway service ID + public URL)
- `content_agency_mvp/STATUS.md` (Day 1 done state)
- `content_agency_mvp/TODO.md` (Day 1 done items checked, Day 2 surfaced)
- `content_agency_mvp/SESSION_LOG.md` (this entry)

**External state changes:**
- Railway: service `5dedec78-e923-4e72-b046-594f408f1755` ACTIVE on us-west2, public domain generated, 7 env vars set
- Sentry: Issue #1 captured (test error — can be resolved later)
- GitHub: 4 commits on main (initial + state-update + http-server + state-update)
- Auto-deploy: any push to main triggers Railway rebuild

**Live verification:**
- ✅ `https://content-agency-mvp-production.up.railway.app/` returns 200 JSON
- ✅ `https://content-agency-mvp-production.up.railway.app/health` returns 200 with `sentryEnabled:true`
- ✅ `POST /throw` → 500 + error in Sentry within seconds

## 2026-04-30 night — Session 1 (Day 1 bootstrap, partial)

**Duration:** ~75 min after pre-flight wrap.

**What happened:**

1. **TypeScript scaffold built.** package.json (Node 20+, ES module, scripts: build/start/dev/smoke/typecheck), tsconfig.json (strict, ES2022, NodeNext), .gitignore (excludes node_modules, dist, .env*, CREDENTIALS.md), .env.example (template), README.md (project intro + layout), .github/workflows/ci.yml (typecheck on PR/main), src/index.ts entry point, src/lib/env.ts (validated env loader), src/lib/sentry.ts (init wrapper + brand-context tagging).

2. **`npm install` clean.** 76 packages, 0 vulnerabilities. `@anthropic-ai/sdk@^0.32.1`, `@sentry/node@^8.42.0`, `@supabase/supabase-js@^2.46.1`, devDeps: tsx + typescript + @types/node.

3. **TypeScript compiles clean.** `npm run typecheck` zero errors.

4. **Initial commit + GitHub push.** Repo: https://github.com/ivansierrax/content-agency-mvp (private). Initial commit hash captured in git log.

5. **`gh` CLI installed.** `brew install gh` (Homebrew 5.1.8) → `gh auth login --hostname github.com --git-protocol https --web` → first round only had `gist`, `read:org`, `repo` scopes → push rejected for `.github/workflows/ci.yml` without `workflow` scope → `gh auth refresh -s workflow` → second OAuth round granted workflow scope → `git push -u origin main` succeeded.

**What's not done (deferred to next session):**

- Railway linked to GitHub repo + env vars set + first deploy
- Sentry smoke verification (run `--throw` flag on Railway, see error in Sentry within 30s)
- This is what closes Day 1

**Lessons learned (consider promoting to feedback memory):**

- `gh` CLI's default scope from `gh auth login` is `gist + read:org + repo`. To push files under `.github/workflows/`, must run `gh auth refresh -s workflow` afterward. The lock-step "first time? refresh scope" is a one-time tax — can be combined into single `gh auth login -s workflow` next time.
- GitHub MCP's PAT lacks `repo` scope for personal-account repo creation — got `403 Resource not accessible by personal access token`. Workaround: use `gh` CLI or have user create repo manually. Adding the right scope to MCP's PAT would future-proof this.
- npm install in Dropbox folder seems fine (no obvious slowdown despite Dropbox sync). Watch for if it becomes an issue with larger node_modules later.

**What's next:**

- Day 1 finish: link Railway → GitHub, set env vars, trigger first deploy, smoke-test Sentry.
- Resume next session with `[MVP] resume`.

**Blockers:** None — just waiting on Railway dashboard work next session.

**New decisions logged:** None new.

**New files this session:**
- `content_agency_mvp/package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `README.md`
- `content_agency_mvp/src/index.ts`
- `content_agency_mvp/src/lib/env.ts`, `src/lib/sentry.ts`
- `content_agency_mvp/.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `content_agency_mvp/package-lock.json` (npm install)
- `content_agency_mvp/.git/` (local git repo)

**Files updated this session:**
- `content_agency_mvp/STATUS.md` (Day 1 halfway state)
- `content_agency_mvp/TODO.md` (Day 1 done items checked, Day 1 finish items surfaced)

**External state changes:**
- GitHub: new private repo `ivansierrax/content-agency-mvp` with initial commit
- gh CLI: authenticated with `gist`, `read:org`, `repo`, `workflow` scopes (keychain-stored)
- Local git: configured (user.email=ivan@hashtag.com.mx, user.name="Ivan Sierra"), origin set to GitHub HTTPS

## 2026-04-30 late-evening — Session 0.5 (Pre-flight)

**Duration:** ~45 min after Session 0 wrap.

**What happened:**

Provisioned all 4 SaaS accounts/projects via Chrome MCP (Ivan handled OAuth/ToS approvals; I filled forms and captured outputs).

- **GitHub:** confirmed `ivansierrax` via mcp__github__get_me. No setup needed.
- **Supabase:** Ivan logged in via Google SSO (`ivan@hashtag.com.mx`). I created org `Hashtag Agencia` (Personal/Free) and project `content-agency-mvp` (us-west-2, auto-RLS on, Data API on). Captured publishable + secret keys (Ivan pasted secret because Chrome clipboard API hung).
- **Railway:** Ivan SSO'd via GitHub + accepted 2-step ToS. I clicked through "Empty Project" (after one wrong click on Docker Image card — coordinates were shifting due to React re-renders; switched to JS-direct .click() which worked). Renamed auto-generated `industrious-creativity` → `content-agency-mvp`.
- **Sentry:** Ivan SSO'd via GitHub. I filled new-org form (`Hashtag Agencia`, US data region), Node.js platform onboarding. DSN captured (Ivan pasted because Chrome MCP's privacy filter blocked DSN-shaped URL output via JS).

**Lessons learned (some belong in feedback memory later):**

1. Chrome MCP has overzealous output filters — anything matching `[hash]@[domain]` URL shape gets BLOCKED even when it's a public DSN. Workaround: Ivan paste-back is faster than fighting the filter.
2. Coordinate-based clicks on Radix-style UIs are unreliable because options re-order/re-render. JS-direct `element.click()` via `document.querySelector` is the reliable pattern.
3. Element refs from `find` tool expire fast — don't trust them across more than one tool call.
4. Supabase / Railway / Sentry all use single-page apps that never reach `document_idle`, breaking screenshot/read_page. JS-direct DOM queries are the workaround.
5. Pre-flight took ~45 min for 4 services with this approach. With cleaner tooling could be ~15 min. Acceptable for one-time setup.

**What's next:**

- Day 1 (Bootstrap). All credentials available in CREDENTIALS.md. Clock starts whenever Ivan picks up — recommend Mon 2026-05-04 for fresh head, but technically unblocked tonight.
- Resume next session with `[MVP] resume`.

**Blockers:** None.

**New decisions logged:** None new (D-007 still the latest).

**New files this session:**
- `content_agency_mvp/CREDENTIALS.md` (full credentials registry — DO NOT COMMIT)

**Files updated this session:**
- `content_agency_mvp/STATUS.md` (pre-flight checked off, infra status → yellow)
- `content_agency_mvp/TODO.md` (pre-flight item checked)

## 2026-04-30 evening — Session 0 (Planning)

**Duration:** ~3 hours of conversation (long session — established posture + audit + scoped MVP).

**What happened:**

1. **Operating posture installed.** Edited `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to add "Operating posture" section enforcing senior-staff-engineer behavior across all future sessions (not just MVP). Created `feedback_senior_architect_mindset.md` memory file. Updated `MEMORY.md` index. This is the meta-change that makes all subsequent work different.

2. **Existing n8n stack audited.** Wrote `n8n_audit_2026-04-30.md`. 81 workflows reviewed, ~25 active. Verdict: 80% is fine in n8n; only 7 (the content-pipeline agent chain) need migration. Don't burn down what works.

3. **Phase 0 completed.** Archived 27 dead n8n workflows (renamed with `[ARCHIVED 2026-04-30]` prefix per existing convention). Caught my own gap mid-archive — 4 "legacy scrapers" I'd flagged as dead are actually production cron jobs feeding HP. Surfaced + skipped them. (`SCRAPPER V2` flagged as failing zombies — separate cleanup later.)

4. **Scope reframed.** Ivan revealed actual product vision (8 paramount points): multi-tenant AI content agency, sellable to hundreds of SMB brands at $25-35K MXN/month, IG+LinkedIn, full FSD, learning loop, can't keep breaking. This is a different beast than the original "migrate the pipeline" task.

5. **Pushed back on impossible 2-week-with-everything scope.** Honest engineering estimate for Ivan's full ask: 4-6 weeks. Offered a trade: 2-week MVP with cuts (IG-only, no learning loop, no admin UI). Ivan accepted the cuts. Locked.

6. **Architecture decided** (D-001 through D-007 in DECISIONS.md). Highlights:
   - Multi-tenancy: shared backend + Notion-per-brand (D-001)
   - Stack: Node/TS, Supabase, Anthropic SDK with prompt caching, Railway, Sentry (D-002)
   - Foundation: port-then-refactor existing pipeline (D-003)
   - Platform: IG only for MVP (D-004); LinkedIn → weeks 3-4
   - No learning loop in MVP (D-005); → weeks 5-6
   - Full FSD autonomy default (D-006)
   - n8n stays for triggers + Publisher + alerts (D-007)

7. **Continuity infrastructure built.** This `content_agency_mvp/` folder + 8 state files. Master `Claude/CLAUDE.md` updated with `[MVP]` trigger. Resume protocol defined (`RESUME.md`).

**What's next:**

- Day 1 (Bootstrap). See `TODO.md` "Right now" section.
- Pre-flight: Ivan confirms Supabase / Railway / Sentry / GitHub accounts.
- Resume next session with: `[MVP] resume`

**Blockers:** None.

**Open questions:** Tracked in `TODO.md` "Open questions" section.

**New decisions logged:** D-001 through D-007 in `DECISIONS.md`.

**Files touched this session (outside MVP folder):**
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (added Operating posture section)
- `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_senior_architect_mindset.md` (new)
- `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md` (added index entry)
- `Claude/CLAUDE.md` (added Project C — MVP — trigger)
- `Claude/n8n_audit_2026-04-30.md` (new — pre-MVP audit)
- 27 n8n workflows renamed `[ARCHIVED 2026-04-30] ...`
